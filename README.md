## üß† What Does This Workflow Do?

This workflow automates the journey from a form submission to receiving a call from an AI voice bot.  
It consists of the following steps:

## üß© Workflow Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Tally Form Submission
- A user submits a response on the Tally form.
- Responses include user details like **name, number, purpose**, etc.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Webhook Node
- The form submission is sent to a **Webhook URL** inside your workflow.
- This node acts as a **trigger** to start the automation.
- It listens for **incoming data from Tally**.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Airtable Node (Database Update)
- The data received via the Webhook is sent to **Airtable**.
- Airtable stores each response in a structured table.
- Airtable acts as the **backend database** for tracking submissions.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: HTTP Request to Vapi
- Once the data is stored, the workflow sends an **HTTP POST request** to [**Vapi.ai**](https://vapi.ai).
- This request includes:
  - The **user‚Äôs phone number**
  - The **Vapi assistant ID**
- The Vapi AI Voice Bot then **calls the user** using the **Twilio phone number**.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è _Ensure your webhook URL is connected properly inside Tally's integration settings. Airtable columns should match incoming data fields. The HTTP request must use correct Vapi credentials and Assistant ID._
