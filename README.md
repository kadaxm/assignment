> üìû After submission, you will receive an automated call from the Twilio number: **+1 320-429-6710**

## üß† What Does This Workflow Do?

This workflow automates the journey from a form submission to receiving a call from an AI voice bot.  
It consists of the following steps:

---

## üß© Workflow Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Tally Form Submission
- A user submits a response on the Tally form.
- Responses include user details like **name, number, purpose**, etc.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Webhook Node
- The form submission is sent to a **Webhook URL** inside your workflow.
- This node acts as a **trigger** to start the automation.
- It listens for **incoming data from Tally**.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Airtable Node (Database Update)
- The data received via the Webhook is sent to **Airtable**.
- Airtable stores each response in a structured table.
- Airtable acts as the **backend database** for tracking submissions.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: HTTP Request to Vapi
- Once the data is stored, the workflow sends an **HTTP POST request** to [**Vapi.ai**](https://vapi.ai).
- This request includes:
  - The **user‚Äôs phone number**
  - The **Vapi assistant ID**
- The Vapi AI Voice Bot then **calls the user** using the **Twilio phone number**.

Once you fill out the [form](https://tally.so/r/w84Gkx):

1. ‚úÖ Your data is saved to **Airtable**
2. ‚úÖ An **AI Voice Call** is triggered via **Vapi & Twilio**
3. ‚úÖ You‚Äôll receive a **real-time call** from the Vapi assistant

---

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è _Ensure your webhook URL is connected properly inside Tally's integration settings. Airtable columns should match incoming data fields. The HTTP request must use correct Vapi credentials and Assistant ID._

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on [`voicebot.json`](https://github.com/kadaxm/assignment/blob/0db0aaf77dc13534b101f190ed3be4882df2ddc4/VoiceBot.JSON) Workflow (Incomplete)

The second part of the automation ‚Äì which processes the voice call conversation and extracts structured data from it ‚Äì is currently **incomplete** due to the following reasons:

1. **Ngrok & Docker Configuration Issues**
   - I faced difficulties in consistently hosting my webhook endpoint due to conflicts with **Docker container routing** and **Ngrok tunneling**.
   - As a result, the Vapi platform was unable to reliably reach the webhook to deliver conversation data.

2. **Vapi Not Sending Response Data**
   - Although the Vapi assistant successfully makes the call and completes the conversation,
     it **does not send the structured JSON payload** back to my webhook URL as expected.
   - The webhook in `voicebot.json` receives a "check" ping (indicating Vapi is trying),
     but no actual **conversation transcript or data** is received.

3. **Workflow Yet to be Connected to Post-Call Actions**
   - Steps like:
     - Parsing structured data (Name, Phone, Purpose, etc.)
     - Writing to Google Sheets or Airtable
     - Triggering confirmation emails based on the type of inquiry (Job / Admission)
     - Using `IF` or `Switch` nodes for branching logic  
     are **not yet implemented** because the required conversation data hasn't been received from the webhook.
